🧠 NumPy Essentials with Python

This repository contains a set of focused Python scripts that demonstrate important concepts, techniques, and optimizations using NumPy — the foundational library for numerical computing in Python.

Each script is crafted to highlight a specific capability or behavior of NumPy arrays and operations.

📂 Script Overview

🔹 basic numpy operations.py

Covers array creation, arithmetic operations, and common NumPy functions.

🔹 concept_of_axis.py

Explains how axis=0 and axis=1 affect operations like sum, mean, and transpose.

🔹 slicing_stacking arrays_indexing with boolean arrays.py

Demonstrates slicing techniques, stacking arrays, and advanced indexing with boolean conditions.

🔹 iterate numpy array using numpy nditer.py

Efficient ways to iterate over multi-dimensional arrays using np.nditer.

🔹 Fast and Convenient.py

Highlights shortcuts and techniques for writing concise, efficient NumPy code.

🔹 less memory.py

Shows how to reduce memory consumption using data type control (dtype) and view-based operations.
